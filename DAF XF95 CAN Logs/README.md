# CAN Bus Logs From DAF XF95

A very important part of the project was to record the logs from the truck to understand which packets to send to the dashboard.
I recorded several logs from the I-CAN bus and V-CAN bus. Both transmit data at a speed of 250KB/s.
Some work on the data packets I enclosed in the Excel files where I described what bit in the packet is responsible for.

Some very useful ones pdf files for those who are also interested in replicating the project - linked to the tachograph and its CAN bus and another - FMS standard description (commercial transport has common address for data transfer)
